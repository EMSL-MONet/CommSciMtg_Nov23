Biogeochemistry and Respiration
================

## Know Before You Go

The data and scripts in this directory will be used for the following sessions:
- Tues, Nov 7: Session 3 Data Tutorial 1 (Exploring Soil Biogeochemistry & Respiration Data)
- Wed, Nov 8: Session 4 Hands on Learning, Breakout Room 3 (Soil Biogeochemistry and Respiration: From Raw to Processed Data)
<br>

We have a Shiny App for quick and easy exploration of the data discussed here. 
The App can be accessed [here](https://shinyproxy.emsl.pnnl.gov/app/1000soils).


## Prerequistes for Session 4

- The _respiration_ demonstration and tutorial (link [here](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov23/blob/main/Biogeochem/Respration%20Curve%20Fitting%20with%20Excel.docx))
will be conducted using Microsoft Excel. Users will need to install the **Solver add-in** before the meeting;
install instructions are provided in step 5 of the tutorial. 

- The _biogeochemistry_ demonstration and tutorial (link [here]()) will be conducted using R,
but users can use Microsoft Excel if they prefer. Users must download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) before the meeting.
The tutorial contains scripts that use `{tidyverse}`;
users must download and install the necessary packages prior to the session.

## Workshop Session: Session 3
### Learning Objective
- Demonstrate the functionality of the Shiny App.
- Understand how to explore the biogeochemistry data.
- Understand how to transfer respiration data from raw to processed data and how to plot and fit respiration data.

### Agenda
1-2 p.m on Tuesday, November 7, 2023
•5 mins: Overview of MONet Shiny App (Qian)
oIntroduce the background and purpose of the App.
oShow the list of biogeochemical data used in the App.
•25 mins: Go over details in MONet Shiny App Visualization Tool (Layton)
oShow each functions in the app.
•15 mins: Exploring Soil Biogeochemistry data by using the Shiny App (Kaizad)
oShow hypothesis driven correlations.

oIntroduce respirometer and protocol.
oShow data processing from raw to processed data.
oFit respiration curve and compare fitting parameters between samples.

## Workshop Session: Session 4 (hands on session)
### Learning Objective
- Demonstrate patterns and correlations among biogeochemical variables.
- Understand how to transfer respiration data from raw to processed data.
- Plot respiration data and conduct non-linear fitting.
- Correlate fitting parameters of respiration data with other metadata of the samples. 

### Agenda

10am, 11am, noon (three 1-hour session) on Wednesday, November 8, 2023

  •10 mins: Intro to the session (Whole group)
    oIntroduce two sections (biogeochemistry data and respiration data)
    oSet up guidelines and show data and examples.
•30 mins: Students Explore Data (Three teams)
    oUse a subset of data to explore biogeochemistry and respiration.
•10 mins: Feedbacks and Discussion (Whole group)
    o2 or 3 students share their findings
•5 mins: Recap and Q&A
