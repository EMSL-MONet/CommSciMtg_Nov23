Biogeochemistry and Respiration
================

## Know Before You Go

The data and scripts in this directory will be used for the following sessions:
- Tues, Nov 7: Session 3 Data Tutorial 1 (Exploring Soil Biogeochemistry & Respiration Data)
- Wed, Nov 8: Session 4 Hands on Learning, Breakout Room 3 (Soil Biogeochemistry and Respiration: From Raw to Processed Data)
<br>

We have a Shiny App for quick and easy exploration of the data discussed here. The App can be accessed [here](https://shinyproxy.emsl.pnnl.gov/app/1000soils).

## Prerequistes for Session 4

We will use Microsoft Excel for the respiration learning session. Users will need to install the **Solver add-in** before the meeting, install instructions are provided in step 5 of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov23/blob/main/Biogeochem/Respration%20Curve%20Fitting%20with%20Excel.docx).

R. Download R and RStudio. [links to R]. users will need the following packages pre-installed ---
mac vs. pc / vs \

## Workshop Session: Session 3
### Learning Objective
- demonstrate the functionality of the Shiny App and interpret ....

### Agenda
1-2 p.m on Tuesday, November 7, 2023
•5 mins: Overview of MONet Shiny App (Qian)
oIntroduce the background and purpose of the App.
oShow the list of biogeochemical data used in the App.
•25 mins: Go over details in MONet Shiny App Visualization Tool (Layton)
oShow each functions in the app.
•15 mins: Exploring Soil Biogeochemistry data by using the Shiny App (Kaizad)
oShow hypothesis driven correlations.

## Workshop Session: Session 4 (hands on session)
### Learning Objective
- demonstrate patterns and correlations among biogeochemical variables

Respiration:
- Understand how to transfer respiration data from raw to processed data.
- Plot respiration data and conduct non-linear fitting.
- Correlate fitting parameters with other metadata of the samples. 

### Agenda

•10 mins: Intro to the session (Whole group)
oIntroduce two sections (biogeochemistry data and respiration data)
oSet up guidelines and show data and examples.
•30 mins: Students Explore Data (Three teams)
oUse a subset of data to explore biogeochemistry and respiration.
•10 mins: Feedbacks and Discussion (Whole group)
o2 or 3 students share their findings
•5 mins: Recap and Q&A
