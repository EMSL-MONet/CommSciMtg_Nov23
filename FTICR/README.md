# FTICR MS

## Workshop Session
What: Session 4: Hands-on Learning   <br>
When: Wednesday Nov 8th: 10am – 11 am, 11 am- 12 noon, or  12 noon- 1pm  <br>
Where:  EMSL 1077, Breakout Room 2

•	Nicole DiDonato | Chemist | EMSL  <br>
•	Cheng Shi | DGEP fellow/PhD student | Oregon State University <br>
•	Will Kew |Chemist| EMSL <br>


## Know Before You Go
This hands on session is intended to allow participants to become familiar with FT-ICR-MS data, common visualizations and data usage. The material will be presented using a jupyter notebook script designed for novice users. Participants should make every effort to utilize the jupyter notebook in order to get the most out of the session, even they are more familiar with another scripting language.

## Prerequistes
Python install: https://www.python.org/downloads/  (Tested on version 3.11.3 and 3.10) <br>
Jupyter notebook install: https://jupyter.org/install (Tested on version 6.5.4 and 7) <br>
Libraries: <br>
Seaborn (Tested on version 0.12.1) <br>
Pandas (Tested on version 2.0.2) <br>
Numpy (Tested on version 1.24.3) <br>
Matplotlib (Tested on version 3.7.1) <br>
Scipy (Tested on version 1.11.3) <br>

## Data Access
All the materials needed for the hands on session are located in this repository: https://github.com/EMSL-MONet/CommSciMtg_Nov23/tree/main/FTICR

### Learning Objective
After completing this hands on session, you will be able to:

•	Load and inspect FT-ICR-MS data using Jupyter Notebook <br>
•	Run code within Jupyter Notebook to execute Python code and render FTICRMS visualizations <br>
•	Calculate molecular properties and make common plots of data (van krevelen, DBE, aromaticity, elemental compositions, class compositions) <br>
•	Correlate FT-ICR-MS molecular properties with measured soil properties <br>
•	Become familiar with FTICRMS data and visualizations <br>

### Before The Day
1. If you do not already have python and jupyter notebook, please install here:
python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/install 

2. Download the FTICRMS folder for this session from GitHUb including:
•	Jupyter Notebook ipynb workshop file: "MONet_HandsOnSession.ipynb" <br>
•	Test file "HelloWorld_test.ipynb" <br>
•	Datafiles:  <br>
"icr.reps.combined_v1_clean.csv" (1000Soils Pilot FT-ICR-MS data) <br>
"Summary_Merged_ZenodoShinyAp.csv" (Summary file) <br>

3. Run the test file script that will import functions you will need during the hands on session.
If you have any trouble or do not see a “Congratulations, you are ready for the hands on session on Nov 8”, please
contact Will Kew (wkew@pnnl.gov) or Nicole DiDonato (nicole.didonato@pnnl.gov) with any issues or questions.
