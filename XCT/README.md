# XCT

# Know before you go

## What to expect when you attend the workshop:

* Hands-on learning of basic processing, segmentation, and visualization of 3D tomography data using Fiji
* Basic porosity analysis in Excel
* Data visualization using ParaView
* Demo XCT data analysis using Google Colab Notebook

## What do you need to install, instructions on how to get to the program?

**Install Fiji:**

1. Download and install Fiji, an open-source image analysis software: https://fiji.sc/
2. See the file "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" for details on how to install Fiji.

**Install ParaView:**

1. Download ParaView software for visualization: https://www.paraview.org/download/
2. See slide 2 in "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" for instructions on how to install ParaView.

**Check if Fiji works:**

1. Open the file "Soil core 2 top zoom_500x500x500_8b".
2. See slides 4-7 in "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" for help.

**Check if ParaView works by double clicking the ParaView icon**

## Tips and troubleshooting

* Please install Fiji and ParaView ahead of time.
* If you have any problems installing or using Fiji or ParaView, please see the file "XCT_tutorial_Fiji.pptx" or contact the workshop organizers for help.

## Where is the data?

* Link to download the data for the Fiji-based exercise: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8377888.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8377888)
* For the ParaView-Googe Colab exercise (Simple XCT toy data analysis using CV) the link is:
* XCT (sub-volume) Google Colab Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tbm49gRwDpvYKg5ukrrtfSo8yshRLil7?usp=sharing
* Complete XCT data and associated analysis are available through Jupyter Lab notebooks. Please see XCT_FullDataAnalysis_Notebook.ipynb
* The dataset for this CV-based analysis is available in the Images Folder of this GitHub. 

## Agenda on contents of the workshop

### Learning outcomes of the day:

* Understanding 3D data, its processing and analysis, as well as visualization with an emphasis on flow and transport in soil

### What did we do?

* Opened 3D XCT image data
* Performed basic data processing steps
* Segmented porosity from soil data
* Visualized pore structure
* Performed basic pore size analysis
* Performed simple CV XCT data analysis using Google Colab Notebook
* Visualized the generated VTK file using ParaView

### What can you do on your own?

* All of the steps in this hands-on tutorial can be done on your own
